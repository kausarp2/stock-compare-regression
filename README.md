# stock-compare-regression
Using the least squares regression between Apple and Microsoft stock prices since last year, I analyzed the behavior of these stocks and attempted to display traces of co-dependence. Using a linear regression methodology, I found that changes in Microsoft's price affect Apple's price more than the other way around.
